- Connect with **wearable devices** (e.g., smartwatches, fitness trackers) to analyze physiological data like **heart rate and sleep patterns**.  
- Utilize **real-time emotion detection** through facial recognition and voice tone analysis.  

---

### **3. Enhanced Personalization**  
- Use **reinforcement learning** to improve chatbot interactions and **personalized recommendations**.  
- Develop **user-specific dashboards** that adapt based on historical mental health trends.  

---

### **4. Multi-Language Support**  
- Expand NLP capabilities to support **multiple languages**, making the chatbot accessible to a **global audience**.  
- Implement **regional mental health resources and culturally sensitive recommendations**.  

---

### **5. AI-Powered Therapy Assistance**  
- Integrate **AI-driven cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)** techniques to provide **interactive self-help exercises**.  
- Implement **AI-generated mental health coaching** for continuous guidance.  

---

### **6. Mobile App Development**
