1. Introduction
The Calmora platform is a mental health and wellness web application designed to provide users with tools and support to improve their emotional well-being. The platform leverages a combination of AI-driven analysis, personalized recommendations, and interactive features to help users track their mood, engage in mindfulness activities, and receive personalized suggestions for improving their mental health.

In today's fast-paced world, mental health issues like stress, anxiety, and depression are prevalent, and the need for accessible support systems is higher than ever. Calmora addresses this gap by offering a self-help tool that combines mood tracking, mental health exercises, and AI-powered insights.

Goals:
Empower users to track their mood and mental health over time.
Provide real-time personalized recommendations to alleviate stress or anxiety.
Use data-driven insights to optimize the mental well-being experience.
Promote mindfulness and personal reflection through daily journal entries.
2. Features
The Calmora platform offers a variety of features designed to support users on their mental health journey:

Key Features:
Mood Tracking: Users can log their daily mood using a simple scale (1-10) or emoji-based input.
Personalized Recommendations: Using AI models, the platform provides tailored mindfulness exercises, meditation guides, and activities based on the user’s mood and mental state.
Mood Diary: A private space for users to jot down thoughts and reflections, helping to track emotional trends.
Real-Time AI Chatbot: Offers interactive, real-time guidance and support based on the user’s input.
Music Therapy: Based on the user's mood, Calmora recommends relaxing music or playlists to help reduce stress.
Stress Level Alerts: Users receive notifications when their recorded stress levels exceed a certain threshold, prompting them to engage in a calming activity.
Progress Reports: Users can download personalized reports in PDF or CSV format summarizing their mood trends, activities, and stress levels over time.
External API Integrations: Integrate third-party services such as weather forecasts or motivational quotes APIs to enhance user engagement.
These features combine to create a holistic approach to improving mental health and emotional well-being.

3. Technologies Used
The Calmora platform utilizes a combination of frontend and backend technologies, as well as AI/ML models to create a seamless user experience.

Frontend Technologies:
HTML: For the basic structure of the web pages.
CSS: For styling and layout. We use custom CSS along with Bootstrap to ensure the app is responsive and accessible across different devices.
JavaScript: For dynamic behavior on the client side, such as handling form submissions, user input, and displaying real-time mood trends.
Backend Technologies:
Python: The core programming language used for server-side development, data processing, and implementing AI/ML algorithms.
Django: A Python-based web framework used to build the backend. Django handles the routing, database management, user authentication, and API integration.
SQLite3: A lightweight, serverless database used for storing user data, mood logs, and activity logs.
Third-Party APIs:
Weather APIs: Integrate weather data to suggest exercises based on current weather conditions (e.g., outdoor activities for sunny days).
Motivational Quote APIs: Fetch and display positive quotes to boost user mood.
Music APIs: For music therapy integration, recommending relaxing playlists based on user mood.
AI/ML Technologies:
Machine Learning: We use machine learning algorithms to analyze user data and generate personalized activity recommendations. This involves data preprocessing, model training, and deployment within the Django backend.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): For analyzing user input in the mood diary and chatbot interactions, NLP models help to extract key emotional indicators and adjust recommendations accordingly.
4. Dataset
The dataset used for the Calmora platform plays a pivotal role in its AI/ML-powered recommendations. Here's an overview of the data:

Mood Data: Users enter their mood data daily, which is stored in the database. This data forms the foundation for understanding emotional trends.

Example: Scale ratings (1-10) or emoji-based selections (Happy, Sad, Neutral, etc.)
Activity Data: Logs of user activities, such as exercises, meditations, and journaling, are tracked.

External Data:

Weather Data: Collected via third-party weather APIs to offer activity suggestions based on the weather (e.g., "It's sunny today, how about a 10-minute walk outside?").
Quotes: Fetching motivational quotes from an external API to inspire users during stressful periods.
AI Model Training Dataset:
The AI models are trained on historical mood and activity data, with the goal of predicting the most effective activities based on user mood. The models use Supervised Learning algorithms, trained on labeled mood data and corresponding activities.

5. System Architecture
The Calmora platform uses a client-server architecture with a Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern facilitated by Django.

Frontend:
Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.
ReactJS components are used for dynamic interactions and to display mood data and recommendations.
Backend:
Django serves as the main backend framework, handling routing, views, templates, and database interactions.
SQLite3 is used as the database to store user profiles, mood logs, and activity data.
AI/ML Layer:
The AI models are written in Python and are integrated into Django using custom APIs. These models predict the most suitable activities based on the user's recorded mood and activity history.
External APIs:
Integrated through Django API calls to third-party services for weather data, motivational quotes, and music recommendations.
User Authentication:
Django's built-in authentication system is used for managing user accounts and securing sensitive data.
6. Model Workflow
The AI model workflow for generating personalized recommendations follows these key steps:

Data Input:

Users provide their mood ratings and complete activities.
Additional data such as weather conditions or external events can also be factored in through third-party APIs.
Data Preprocessing:

Data such as mood logs, activity completion rates, and external inputs (weather, quotes) are cleaned and formatted for model analysis.
Text inputs from the mood diary are processed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract emotional tone and stress indicators.
Model Training:

Machine Learning models are trained using historical user data to identify patterns between mood states and effective activities.
Supervised learning algorithms, such as Random Forests or Support Vector Machines (SVM), are used to predict the best recommendations based on user behavior.
Model Output:

Based on the analysis, the system outputs personalized recommendations such as meditation sessions, breathing exercises, motivational quotes, or music therapy suggestions.
Feedback Loop:

As users interact with the app and provide more data, the system learns and refines its recommendations to become more personalized over time.

Database Design:
The SQLite3 database is designed with several key tables:

Users: Stores basic user information (username, email, password).
Mood Logs: Stores daily mood entries (rating, timestamp, user_id).
Activities: Stores recommended activities based on mood.
Weather: Stores daily weather information (for activity suggestions).
8. Results
Performance Metrics:
AI model accuracy is evaluated using confusion matrix and cross-validation to assess how well the recommendation system predicts the correct activities for each mood.
User Engagement: Metrics such as daily active users, average mood ratings, and activity completion rates.
Model Performance: Precision and recall scores for AI model predictions.
Visuals like charts and graphs displaying mood trends and activity completion will provide valuable insights into the system’s effectiveness.
