AI powered mental health diagnosis
1. Importing Libraries and Data
Various libraries for data manipulation, visualization, model building, and statistical analysis are imported. These include libraries such as pandas, numpy, sklearn, and matplotlib.
A dataset (likely related to mental health in tech workers) is loaded using pandas from a CSV file.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The dimensions of the dataset are checked, which is (1259 rows x 27 columns). This provides insight into the number of data points and features available for analysis.
3. Mental Health Detection Model
The goal of the notebook is to train a model to predict mental health conditions based on user input (likely text data).
Various machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision tree classifiers, and ensemble models like random forests and bagging classifiers, are discussed.
The model's ability to predict mental health states based on user responses will be evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
4. Features for Detection
Key features in the dataset are likely analyzed to build the predictive model. This could involve text analysis, user responses, or other related data to identify mental health risks.
5. Action Triggers (Alerts & Suggestions)
Once the mental health condition is detected, alerts (such as an email notification) are triggered.
The chatbot then provides users with suggestions, including:
Music recommendations for relaxation.
Yoga practices for mental health improvement.
Relaxation tips based on user mood and responses.
6. User Dashboard and Feedback
The project includes an interactive dashboard where users can:
Register using OTP and log in to access their personal details.
View a mental health detection page where they can track their condition over time.
Use the chatbot Perplexity  API to get real-time assistance with relaxation techniques and mood management.
Download reports with their detected mental health conditions and relaxation tips.
Update personal details and provide feedback about their experience.
7. Mood Assistance and History
Users can search for specific moods and explore content related to those moods, such as music, yoga videos, and other resources.
There is an option for users to view their history of detected conditions and download detailed reports.
8. Google Dialogflow Integration
The chatbot uses Google Dialogflow for Natural Language Processing (NLP). Dialogflow enables the chatbot to process user inputs and provide helpful suggestions.
The chatbot assists with mood analysis, suggests appropriate music and yoga exercises, and provides relaxation techniques.

This project appears to be a comprehensive mental health assistant system that combines machine learning, NLP, and user interactivity to help individuals identify potential mental health issues, receive real-time suggestions for improvement, and track their progress. It also includes a user-friendly dashboard for personal data management and feedback.
